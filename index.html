        <div class="boxm">  A cafe that is also an escape room would combine the concepts of both a cafe and an escape room. This could mean that the cafe has one or more rooms dedicated to the escape room experience, where customers can book a time to participate in the game while enjoying food and drinks from the cafe.
            
            The escape room part of the cafe could have its own theme or storyline, perhaps related to the history of the building or a fictional scenario. The puzzles and clues would be integrated into the environment of the room, making use of props and decorations to create an immersive experience.
            
            Customers could choose to participate in the escape room experience before or after ordering food and drinks at the cafe, and there could be packages available that combine both activities. The cafe could also offer prizes or discounts to customers who successfully escape the room within the time limit.
            
            Overall, a cafe that is also an escape room would offer a unique and exciting form of entertainment, combining the social atmosphere of a cafe with the thrill of an escape room.</div>
